<h1>Sam's Website For Things He Will Do</h1>
<p>This is a website for things I intend on making.</p>

<h2> Project 1: Construct 2 game </h2>>

<p>1. In this project we planned to create a Pokemon-style video game in Construct 2</p>

<p>2. We planned on making a Pokemon-style game as mentioned before but on a much simpler scale but still using the combat system of the original game.</p>

<p>3. What we achieved was quite different from what we originally planned. We ended up with a more
"Zelda-style" game where you play as Waluigi defeating ghost with his tennis racket (I’m not sure how that happened either). </p>

<p>4. Some problems we encountered were mainly due to a lack of knowledge in the Construct 2 engine but to be more specific we usually got tripped up by animating sprites and giving the enemies better A.I.</p>

<p>5. To be critical of our project there where a few good things that we did well but there is also definitely room to improve. A few things we could have done were:</p>

<p>>Made our own sprites </p>

<p>>Gotten more familiar with the animation software</p>

<p>>used our time more efficiently and used the planner more often </p>

<p>>asked for help I bit more</p>

<p>Although there was some things we did quite well including:</p>

<p>> Made a game that actually works to some degree</p>

<p>> Worked well within the restrictions of the free version of Construct 2</p>

<p>> Worked well as a team and helped each other on the project</p>

<h3>Sam and Dean’s Second Project Report</h3>

<p>1. In this project we used Sculptris to make 3D models</p>

<p>2. Our plan was to make several different designs in the Sculptris engine of a fairly large variety.</p>

<p>3. We achieved something quite similar to what we set out to do including</p>
	
	<p>> A design of Mew and Jigglypuff from Pokémon</p>
	
	<p>> An almost finished design of Squidward from Spongebob</p>

<p>4. We encountered a few problems along the way mainly from Sculptris’ weird saving system where you are unable to undo actions past a certain point or after switching tools.</p>

<p>5. Critically speaking there where a few things we did fairly well but, just like our last project there was definitely room for improvement such as:</p>
	
	<p>> Used a few more tutorials to help flesh out our knowledge of each tool.</p>
	
	<p>> Put a little more effort into the painting of our projects.</p>
	
	<p>> Made more use of detail and gotten used to the Sculptris camera which tripped us                 
         Up a lot.</p>
